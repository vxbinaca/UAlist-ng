# UAlist-ng
An updated and expanded useragent list for WWW::UserAgent::Random.

WWW::UserAgent::Random has't been updated since 2011, but browsers sure have. While I'm aiming to remove old-old-old UA,s I want to expand more recent offerings for Chrome to increase entropy if you will, of plausible UAs.

This list will be useful for pentesters, Perl monks or people who rely on WWW::UserAgent::Random. While I'm not talented enough a programmer to fork that module, I figure the list is easy enough for people to plug into the current source, compile the module and off they go.
